    <h1 class="title">Multiple and Flexible Pathways - calculating the number of children who need better options</h1>
    <p class="body-text">
      This uses household survey (MICS) data and shows, for each country, how many spaces would have been needed to get all children of upper secondary age on a pathway to complete 12 years of schooling. These numbers are representative of one cohort of children – usually 16-18 years old, but varying by country.
    
    <br>
        The maps are coded and marked by the percentage of children needing support to be on track to complete twelve years of education (so all those in this cohort that aren’t enrolled in upper secondary). This reveals a substantial need for investment in multiple and flexible pathways around the world.
    
    <br>
      It does so by looking at how many children never enrolled, or dropped out at each stage. We focus on the three types of children:
      
      <ul>
        <li>those who need alternatives to complete primary school and beyond</li>
      <li>those who completed primary but need alternative pathways to complete lower and upper secondary</li>
      <li>those who just need help to complete upper secondary</li>.
      </ul>
